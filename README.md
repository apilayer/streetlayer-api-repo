Streetlayer offers a straightforward JSON-based REST API service built to analyse and verify international address data by using custom built search algorithms to cross-reference complete addresses (as specified in the API request) as well as each fraction contained therein with a massive, weekly updated and reliable data set sourced from a wide range of vendors and institutions around the world.

Whether your intended use of the API is cleaning your customer database, validating user data at the time it enters your systems, building an address autocomplete system for your web platform or validating high-value contacts or leads with the aim of sending promotional material - regardless of the background or size of your business, you're at the right address.
